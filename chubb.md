1. Key Difference Between Git Fetch and Git Pull
The main difference between Git Fetch and Git Pull:

Git Fetch:

Downloads latest changes from remote repo to stores the changes in a separate branch in our local repository (local remote-tracking branches).
Does not update local working directory.
Does not cause merge conflicts.

Git Pull:

Downloads latest changes from remote repo and merges them into current branch.
Updates local working directory.
Can cause merge conflicts.
In short, git fetch is a safer and more flexible option, while git pull is faster and easier to use, but it can lead to merge conflicts.

2. Docker Registry vs Repository

Docker registry is a service that is storing your docker images.

Docker registry could be hosted by a third party, as public or private registry, like one of the following registries:

Docker Hub,
Quay,
Google Container Registry,
AWS Container Registry
or you can host the docker registry by yourself
(see https://docs.docker.com/ee/dtr/ for more details).

Docker repository is a collection of different docker images with same name, that have different tags. Tag is alphanumeric identifier of the image within a repository.

3. ADD vs CMD

The CMD commandâ€‹ specifies the instruction that is to be executed when a Docker container starts
The ADD command Copy local files from the host machine into the Docker image. Download files from a remote URL and add them to the Docker image

4. 3 components of docker
Docker follows Client-Server architecture, which includes the three main components that are Docker Client, Docker Host, and Docker Registry

5. Declarative vs Scripted pipeline

Declarative provides richer syntactical features over Scripted Pipeline syntax, and is designed to make writing and reading Pipeline code easier.

7. Docker file
